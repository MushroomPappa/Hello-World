Learning the flow

Born and raised in the greater Charleston area.
With a huge passion for people I've been in the service industry for over ten years.
I love traveling, seeing live music or you can find me in the woods foraging for mushrooms.
Inside, I'm a huge gamer and have been since I was a kid. With that being said, I have a huge love for
computers and technology. Over the years I've cultivated a great work ethic. 
Working hard and playing hard has always been my standard.
I'm easy going. fun to be around, and I bring a good energy to the table.
